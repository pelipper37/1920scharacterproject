						Qualities
					</h3>
				</div>
				<h4>
					Virtues
				</h4>
				<ul>
				    <li>
					    Imagination : The most innovative technologies and theories come with a lot of imagination. It's almost a prerequisite.
					</li>
					</br>
					<li>
						Creativity : Mr. Horaz has shown an ability to offer unconventional strategies, and although they are not always effective, some of them are definitely more effective than conventional tactics.
					</li>
					</br>
					<li>
						Education : Mr. Horaz has an excellent education, graduating from Harvard at the age of 20.
					</li>
					</br>
					<li>
						Knowledge : Education doesn't always translate into knowledge, but Mr. Horaz has shown his knowledge in mathematics, economics, and philosophy. These would almost definitely be useful in the future.
					</li>
					</br>
					<li>
						Influence : Mr. Horaz has the ability to influence other people. If he wants something done, it will likely get done. If he wants a program stopped, it will probably be halted. It is something we look for in an operative.
					</li>
					</br>
					<li>
						Authority : Having influence doesn't always mean it always works, but Mr. Horaz does have a great amount of authority so that what he wants gets done more often than not. It is a quality worth looking into, if not now, then in the future.
					</li>
					</br>
					<li>
						Self-Control : Having power and then abusing it creates enemies, but abuse of power is not something that appears to be a vice of Mr. Horaz. This may be difficult to exploit.
					</li>
					</br>
					<li>
						Calm : Mr. Horaz is known somewhat for being quite calm and logical, even if emotions would run high during a certain moment. It is a very rare trait, and is very helpful.
					</li>
					</br>
					<li>
						Ambition : Every pawn dreams of one day becoming a queen, and Mr. Horaz is no different. This constant drive could be a virtue or it could be a vice. More on that later.
					</li>
					</br>
					<li>
						Enigma : No one knows much about what he does outside of his work. This could be a virtue or it could be a vice. More on that later. 
					</li>
				</ul>
			<h4>
				Vices
			</h4>
				<ul>
					<li>
						Arrogance : While Mr. Horaz doesn't believe that he is the best in the world, but he has a lot of pride, and that is something that we can exploit now or in the future.
					</li>
					</br>
					<li>
						Naivety : Mr. Horaz is not even 30, and has relatively little life experience. The world is not as harmonious as it appears, and as long as Mr. Horaz maintains the sense of innocence and naivety, it is something easily exploited.
					</li>
					</br>
					<li>
						Ambition : Eventually, too much ambition can end in disaster. While we certainly hope it won't come to this, many people possess an overabundance of ambition, and it occurs way too often.
					</li>
					</br>
					<li>
						Impatience : Patience is a virtue, and having too little is a vice. It won't push for an illogical or arbitrary move, but it can cause tempers to flare. It is something that can be noted for later.
					</li>
					</br>
					<li>
						Enigma : Mr. Horaz is a mysterious man outside of his work. What activities he conducts behind the scenes are unknown. Yet, the source of his income is largely unknown. This requires more investigation. Perhaps we could find something that we could use as leverage. Talk to intelligence sources to try to pry information from this enigmatic man.
