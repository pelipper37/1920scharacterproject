				<h4>
					Family Name
				</h4>
				<ul>
					<li>
						Mr. Horaz has a name that may or may not be of note in our efforts to neutralize the threat that he may pose.
					</li>
					</br>
					<li>
						Hugo is a Latin variant of the name Hugh, itself being an English variant of the name Hubert, meaning bright-minded. Fitting considering the troubles he has caused us, and our inability to apprehend him.
					</li>
					</br>
					<li>
						Paul is a Latin name meaning small. Considering how influential he has become without being in the spotlight often, it is a good descriptor of Mr. Horaz's personality.
					</li>
					</br>
					<li>
						Horaz is a variant of Horace, a Latin name. It means "keeper of the hours".
					</li>
				</ul>
				</br>
				<h4>
					Favourite Color (Significance?)
				</h4>
				<p>
					It would appear that Mr. Horaz's favourite colour is blue, which is representative of trust, loyalty, wisdom, imagination, and intelligence.
				</p>
				</br>
				<h4>
					Personal Background
				</h4>
				<p>
					Hugo Paul Horaz was born into the middle-class on 14 June 1897 in Los Angeles, California, during the height of the Gilded Age. His father was a banker, and his mother a schoolteacher. Intelligence has yet to be gathered on those two. He was consistently at the top of his class from an early age, and one could consider him a prodigy in mathematics. Mr. Horaz was accepted into Harvard at the age of 16 and graduated in 1918. Mr. Horaz served in the First World War for 7 weeks before war ended in 1918. He was an ally of James M. Cox of Ohio and was an advisor in his 1920 run for the presidency, but it should be noted that Mr. Horaz's views are more conservative than the progressive and somewhat radical ideologies that the Democratic party embraced after 1884. He currently resides in Los Angeles County.

				<h4>
					Money, Net Worth, and Assets
				</h4>
				<p>
					<!-- Favorite Colors (Significance), Name (Significacnce), Money -->
					Mr. Horaz is in ownership of a total of an estimated 420,000 USD, equivalent to over 20,000 ounces of gold in 1920 prices. Here are a few of his assets: 
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						Current Residence : Mr. Horaz currently resides in a small home, valued to be worth an estimated 8,000 USD.
					</li>
					</br>
					<li>
						Stock Market : Investing in multiple companies in Wall Street, Mr. Horaz has made some sums of money, valued at an estimated 114,000 USD.
					</li>
					</br>
					<li>
						Bank Holdings : Mr. Horaz currently holds an estimated 240,000 USD in the bank.
					</li>
					</br>
					<li>
						Loans : It is estimated that he is owed up to 55,000 USD altogether by multiple loaners.
					</li>
					</br>
					<li>
						Belongings : The rest of his belongings are valued at approximately 3,000 USD.
					</li>
				</ul>
				</br>
				<p>
					It should be noted that although he does have an occupation, it should not offer as much money as we see in his net value. Take careful note of his transactions. It is possible we may find some unregistered activity. This could serve as leverage in the future.
